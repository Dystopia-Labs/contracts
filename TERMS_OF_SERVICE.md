# Terms of Service for $WGMI

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) form a binding legal agreement between each person who holds or has locked up $WGMI tokens (“you”) and Dystopia Labs, Inc (“Dystopia Labs”). $WGMI tokens exist on the Ethereum blockchain at [0x743b8f01e33e4d8358893a196aefa4c4e8712b37](https://etherscan.io/address/0x743b8f01e33e4d8358893a196aefa4c4e8712b37).

##### Acquiring $WGMI

1. By acquiring or holding $WGMI, you have the following rights:

   1.1 to agree to lock up $WGMI for Dystopia Labs’ services; and

   1.2 to sell, transfer, lend, gift or otherwise deal with $WGMI tokens as you see fit. This right is enforced by the $WGMI smart contract and the Ethereum blockchain and is noted here for completeness.

2. These Terms do not impose any obligations or liability on you if all you do is acquire, buy, sell or hold $WGMI. Redemption of $WGMI is subject to the terms set forth below.

##### Max supply of $WGMI

3. There is a maximum of 1,000,000,000 $WGMI tokens that will ever exist.

4. This right is enforced by the $WGMI smart contract and the Ethereum blockchain and are noted here for completeness.

##### Locking up $WGMI

5. You can agree to lock up $WGMI for access to events and event partner services according to mutually agreed upon commercial engagement terms.

6. You cannot agree to lock up $WGMI for any services that:

   6.1 are not agreed between you and Dystopia Labs prior to lockup;

7. If you attempt to lock up $WGMI in contravention of the requirements listed in section 6 above, Dystopia Labs reserves the right to refuse to provide Services and not refund any $WGMI that you have locked up.

8. In order to avoid any doubt, Dystopia Labs may require you to sign a message from the Ethereum address(es) that you intend to purchase $WGMI from and claim $WGMI from post-lockup. This will only be required if there is any doubt or dispute about the person(s) claiming to have made the purchase and lockup redemption transactions.

9. After the lockup period has transpired, all previously locked up $WGMI tokens will expire. After this time, the tokens will still exist in the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, but you will not be able to redeem them for Dystopia Labs’ services until a new lockup and new commercial engagement terms have been agreed upon.

10. Provided that the above criteria are met, Dystopia Labs agrees to provide access to events and event partner services (“Services”) to any person who agrees to lock up $WGMI, on the terms set forth in these Terms.

##### Performing the Services

11. Dystopia Labs will make reasonable best efforts in good faith to provide the Services to you as soon as possible after you agree to lock up $WGMI. Dystopia Labs does not guarantee availability or provide any commitment about when Dystopia Labs will be able to provide the Services to you.

12. If at any time you attempt to procure Dystopia Labs to provide Services in contravention of the requirements in section 6 above, Dystopia Labs reserves the right to cease to provide Services and to not refund any $WGMI that you have agreed to lock up.

##### Fees

13. Apart from agreeing to purchase and lock up $WGMI, you do not have to pay any other fees for the Services.

##### Limitation of Liability

14. You agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to limit the liability of Dystopia Labs to you for any and all claims, losses, costs, expenses, or damages of any nature whatsoever, from any cause or causes, so that the total aggregate liability of Dystopia Labs to you shall not exceed the US Dollar equivalent value at purchase of $WGMI Tokens locked up in return for Services. It is intended that this limitation apply to any and all liability or causes of action however alleged or arising, unless otherwise specifically prohibited by law. All claims against Dystopia Labs shall be deemed waived unless made in writing and received by Dystopia Labs within one month after completion of the Services with respect to which the claim is being made.

15. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, no Party shall be liable hereunder for any consequential, special, or punitive damages (including lost profits).

16. You accept and acknowledge that there are risks associated with holding or using $WGMI and using the Ethereum Network, including but not limited to, the risk of losing access to your Ethereum address due to loss of private keys, seed words or other credentials, and the risk of unknown vulnerabilities in the $WGMI smart contract code or the Ethereum Network Protocol. You acknowledge and accept all such risks and agree that Dystopia Labs is not responsible and is not liable for any loss of value you may experience as a result. You accept and acknowledge that Dystopia Labs will not be responsible for any losses, failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays you may experience when holding or using $WGMI however caused.

##### Amendments; Updates to the Terms
